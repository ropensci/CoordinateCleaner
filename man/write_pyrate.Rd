\usage{
write_pyrate(
  x,
  status,
  fname,
  taxon = "accepted_name",
  min_age = "min_ma",
  max_age = "max_ma",
  trait = NULL,
  path = getwd(),
  replicates = 1,
  cutoff = NULL,
  random = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data.frame. Containing fossil records with taxon names, ages, 
and geographic coordinates.}

\item{status}{a vector of character strings of length \code{nrow(x)}.
Indicating for each record \dQuote{extinct} or \dQuote{extant}.}

\item{fname}{a character string. The prefix to use for the output files.}

\item{taxon}{character string. The column with the taxon name. 
Default = \dQuote{accepted_name}.}

\item{min_age}{character string. The column with the minimum age. Default
= \dQuote{min_ma}.}

\item{max_age}{character string. The column with the maximum age. Default
= \dQuote{max_ma}.}

\item{trait}{a numeric vector of length \code{nrow(x)}. Indicating trait
values for each record. Optional.  Default = NULL.}

\item{path}{a character string. giving the absolute path to write the output
files. Default is the working directory.}

\item{replicates}{a numerical. The number of replicates for the randomized
age generation. See details. Default = 1.}

\item{cutoff}{a numerical. Specify a threshold to exclude fossil occurrences
with a high temporal uncertainty, i.e. with a wide temporal range between
min_age and max_age. Examples: cutoff=NULL (default; all occurrences are
kept in the data set) cutoff=5 (all occurrences with a temporal range of 5
Myr or higher are excluded from the data set)}

\item{random}{logical. Specify whether to take a random age (between MinT
and MaxT) for each occurrence or the midpoint age. Note that this option
defaults to TRUE if several replicates are generated (i.e. replicates > 1).
Examples: random = TRUE (default) random = FALSE (use midpoint ages)}
}
\value{
PyRate input files in the working directory.
}
\description{
Creates the input necessary to run Pyrate, based on a data.frame with fossil
ages (as derived e.g. from clean_fossils) and a vector of the
extinction status for each sample. Creates files in the working directory!
}
\details{
The replicate option allows the user to generate several replicates of the
data set in a single input file, each time re-drawing the ages of the
occurrences at random from uniform distributions with boundaries MinT and
MaxT. The replicates can be analysed in different runs (see PyRate command
-j) and combining the results of these replicates is a way to account for
the uncertainty of the true ages of the fossil occurrences. Examples:
replicates=1 (default, generates 1 data set), replicates=10 (generates 10
random replicates of the data set).
