}
\value{
Depending on the output argument:
\describe{
\item{\dQuote{spatialvalid}}{an object of class \code{spatialvalid} similar to x
with one column added for each test. TRUE = clean coordinate entry, FALSE = potentially
problematic coordinate entries.  The .summary column is FALSE if any test flagged
the respective coordinate.}
\item{\dQuote{flagged}}{a logical vector with the
same order as the input data summarizing the results of all test. TRUE =
clean coordinate, FALSE = potentially problematic (= at least one test
failed).}
\item{\dQuote{clean}}{a \code{data.frame} similar to x
with potentially problematic records removed}
}
}
\description{
Cleaning geographic coordinates by multiple empirical tests to flag
potentially erroneous coordinates, addressing issues common in biological
collection databases.
}
\details{
The function needs all coordinates to be formally valid according to WGS84.
If the data contains invalid coordinates, the function will stop and return a
vector flagging the invalid records. TRUE = non-problematic coordinate, FALSE
= potentially problematic coordinates.
\itemize{
\item capitals tests a radius around adm-0 capitals. The
radius is \code{capitals_rad}.
\item centroids tests a radius around country centroids.
The radius is \code{centroids_rad}.
\item countries tests if coordinates are from the
country indicated in the country column.  \emph{Switched off by default.}
\item duplicates tests for duplicate records. This
checks for identical coordinates or if a species vector is provided for
identical coordinates within a species. All but the first records are flagged
as duplicates. \emph{Switched off by default.}
\item equal tests for equal absolute longitude and latitude.
\item gbif tests a one-degree radius around the GBIF
headquarters in Copenhagen, Denmark.
\item institutions tests a radius around known
biodiversity institutions from \code{instiutions}. The radius is
\code{inst_rad}.
\item outliers tests each species for outlier records.
Depending on the \code{outliers_mtp} and \code{outliers.td} arguments either
flags records that are a minimum distance away from all other records of this
species (\code{outliers_td}) or records that are outside a multiple of the
interquartile range of minimum distances to the next neighbour of this
species (\code{outliers_mtp}). Three different methods are available for the
outlier test: "If \dQuote{outlier} a boxplot method is used and records are
flagged as outliers if their \emph{mean} distance to all other records of the
same species is larger than mltpl * the interquartile range of the mean
distance of all records of this species. If \dQuote{mad} the median absolute
deviation is used. In this case a record is flagged as outlier, if the
\emph{mean} distance to all other records of the same species is larger than
the median of the mean distance of all points plus/minus the mad of the mean
distances of all records of the species * mltpl. If \dQuote{distance} records
are flagged as outliers, if the \emph{minimum} distance to the next record of
the species is > \code{tdi}.
\item ranges tests if records fall within provided natural range polygons on
a per species basis. See \code{\link{cc_iucn}} for details.
\item seas tests if coordinates fall into the ocean.
\item urban tests if coordinates are from urban areas.
\emph{Switched off by default}
\item validity checks if coordinates correspond to a lat/lon coordinate reference system.
This test is always on, since all records need to pass for any other test to
run.
\item zeros tests for plain zeros, equal latitude and
longitude and a radius around the point 0/0. The radius is \code{zeros.rad}.
}
}
\note{
Always tests for coordinate validity: non-numeric or missing
coordinates and coordinates exceeding the global extent (lon/lat, WGS84).

and tutorials.

The country_refcol argument allows to adapt the function to the
structure of alternative reference datasets. For instance, for
\code{rnaturalearth::ne_countries(scale = "small", returnclass = "sf")}, the default will fail,
but country_refcol = "iso_a3" will work.
