\usage{
cd_ddmm(
  x,
  lon = "decimalLongitude",
  lat = "decimalLatitude",
  ds = "dataset",
  pvalue = 0.025,
  diff = 1,
  mat_size = 1000,

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data.frame. Containing geographical coordinates and species names.}

\item{lon}{character string. The column with the longitude coordinates.
Default = \dQuote{decimalLongitude}.}

\item{lat}{character string. The column with the latitude coordinates.
Default = \dQuote{decimalLatitude}.}

\item{ds}{a character string. The column with the dataset of each record. In
case \code{x} should be treated as a single dataset, identical for all
records.  Default = \dQuote{dataset}.}

\item{pvalue}{numeric. The p-value for the one-sided t-test to flag the test
as passed or not. Both ddmm.pvalue and diff must be met. Default = 0.025.}

\item{diff}{numeric. The threshold difference for the ddmm test. Indicates
by which fraction the records with decimals below 0.6 must outnumber the
records with decimals above 0.6. Default = 1}

\item{mat_size}{numeric. The size of the matrix for the binomial test. Must
be changed in decimals (e.g. 100, 1000, 10000). Adapt to dataset size,
generally 100 is better for datasets < 10000 records, 1000 is better for
datasets with 10000 - 1M records. Higher values also work reasonably well
for smaller datasets, therefore, default = 1000. For large datasets try
10000.}

\item{min_span}{numeric. The minimum geographic extent of datasets to be
tested. Default = 2.}

\item{value}{character string.  Defining the output value. See value.}

\item{verbose}{logical. If TRUE reports the name of the test and the number
of records flagged.}

\item{diagnostic}{logical. If TRUE plots the analyses matrix for each
dataset.}
}
\value{
Depending on the \sQuote{value} argument, either a \code{data.frame}
with summary statistics and flags for each dataset (\dQuote{dataset}) or a
\code{data.frame} containing the records considered correct by the test
(\dQuote{clean}) or a logical vector (\dQuote{flags}), with TRUE = test passed and FALSE =
test failed/potentially problematic. Default =
\dQuote{clean}.
}
\description{
This test flags datasets where a significant fraction of records has
been subject to a common degree minute to decimal degree conversion error,
where the degree sign is recognized as decimal delimiter.
}
\details{
If the degree sign is recognized as decimal delimiter during coordinate
conversion, no coordinate decimals above 0.59 (59') are possible. The test
here uses a binomial test to test if a significant proportion of records in
a dataset have been subject to this problem. The test is best adjusted via
the diff argument. The lower \code{diff}, the stricter the test. Also scales
with dataset size. Empirically, for datasets with < 5,000 unique coordinate
records \code{diff = 0.1} has proven reasonable flagging most datasets with
>25\% problematic records and all dataset with >50\% problematic records.
For datasets between 5,000 and 100,000 geographic unique records \code{diff
= 0.01} is recommended, for datasets between 100,000 and 1 M records diff =
0.001, and so on.
