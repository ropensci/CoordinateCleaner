\description{
Automated Cleaning of Occurrence Records from Biological Collections
}
\details{
Automated flagging of common spatial and temporal errors in biological and
paleontological collection data, for the use in conservation, ecology and
paleontology. Includes automated tests to easily flag (and exclude) records
assigned to country or province centroid, the open ocean, the headquarters of
the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, urban areas or the location of
biodiversity institutions (museums, zoos, botanical gardens, universities).
Furthermore identifies per species outlier coordinates, zero coordinates,
identical latitude/longitude and invalid coordinates. Also implements an
algorithm to identify data sets with a significant proportion of rounded
coordinates. Especially suited for large data sets. See
<https://ropensci.github.io/CoordinateCleaner/> for more details and
tutorials.
