# Version 2.0-20

Fixing a warning resulting from vignette building in the previous version (2.0-18) on CRAN. 

Additionally, change of maintainer email, due to a change in institution.

The package has been removed from CRAN due to slow response time. Response time was slow because I am on parental leave.
